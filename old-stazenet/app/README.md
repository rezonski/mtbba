Example on how to use glu2.js. This application will list all vizwiz projets, enable rename of a project and enable navigation to single project.

To use it, run:

```
    npm install
    gulp development
```

When in browser open http://localhost:5555. Remember to first log in vizwiz using https://dev-vizwiz.socialexplorer.com/#/my-projects, so demo app can use cookie.
